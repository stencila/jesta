## ✨ Features

- Implements `compile`, `build` and `execute` methods for `CodeChunk` or `CodeExpression` nodes with Javascript as their `programmingLanguage`.

- Implements `vars`, `get`, and `set` methods for Node.js sessions.

- Implements `decode` and `encode` methods for format `JSON`.

- An ideal base for other plugins written in Javascript or Typescript (implements `register` and `serve` methods (required for integration with Stencila CLI and Desktop)
- A simple command line interface for running and testing plugin.

## 📦 Install

It is envisioned that this will be the default plugin for Node.js and that you will be able to install it using the Stencila CLI,

```sh
stencila install nodejs
```

Or using the name of this repo directly,

```sh
stencila install jesta
```

None of that is possible right now, and this package isn't even on NPM yet, but you could always install it from GitHub directly if you like:

```sh
npm install stencila/jesta
```

## 💪 Extend

Jesta is designed to be extended. You can create your own Stencila plugin by following these steps.

Initialize your package and add Jesta as a development dependency:

```sh
npm init
npm install stencila/jesta
```

Implement your own `manifest` and override any of Jesta's other methods and in your `index.ts` or `index.js`, call Jesta's `cli` function e.g.

```ts
import { Jesta } from '@stencila/jesta'
import { manifest } from './manifest'

export class MyPlugin extends Jesta {
  manifest = manifest
}

if (require.main === module) new MyPlugin.cli(__filename)
```

## 🛠️ Develop

Get started by cloning this repository, installing dependencies and running the command line interface:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:stencila/jesta
cd jesta
npm install
npm start
```

Please run the formatting, linting and testing scripts when contributing code e.g.

```sh
npm run format
npm run lint
npm run test::watch
```

Alternatively, use `make` if you prefer,

```sh
make format lint test
```

There are also some test fixtures that you can try the CLI out on e.g.

```sh
npm start -- compile+build+execute tests/fixtures/one/index.json
```
